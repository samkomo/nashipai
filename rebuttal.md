We express our gratitude to the reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions, which are invaluable for enhancing the quality and clarity of our manuscript. Below, we detail our planned responses to each comment:

### Response to Reviewer 1

**Comment 1.1: Role of Blockchain in Data Aggregation Mechanism**

We value the reviewer's inquiry on blockchain's role and smart contracts in our framework. To address this, Section III will be revised to highlight blockchain's key role in ensuring a decentralized, secure environment for energy data aggregation and how smart contracts facilitate this process, maintaining data integrity and privacy. This update aims to provide a clearer understanding of blockchain's functionality and smart contracts' operational role in our system.

**Comment 1.2: Clarification on Index Usage**

Thank you for highlighting the ambiguity in our index usage. In response, we will revise Section III to clearly differentiate between the indices for clusters (K_i) and prosumers (pk_i), ensuring that our notation consistently reflects their distinct roles throughout the manuscript.

### Response to Reviewer 2

Acknowledging the reviewer's request for a more detailed exposition of the cryptographic protocols, we plan to incorporate:

1. An in-depth explanation of the MPC and PHE protocols in Section IV, detailing their types, roles, and specific cryptographic schemes employed, such as threshold-based SSS by Cominetti et al. and additive PHE scheme by Mesnager et al..
2. A new instantiation section that outlines our approach to addressing the computational limitations of PHE within our framework and explains our choice of secret sharing scheme.
3. A discussion on the relevance of the recommended paper by Corrigan-Gibbs-Boneh to our work, especially its implications for enhancing our privacy-preserving data aggregation approach.

### Response to Reviewer 3

We value the reviewer's request for more detailed descriptions of the system's architecture and experimental setup:

1. We will thoroughly describe the workflow and integration of smart contracts within the architecture in Section II, including a revised diagram for enhanced clarity.
2. The experimental setup section (Section V) will be expanded to detail the number of nodes, the role of Raspberry Pi in our simulations, and baseline configurations for comparative analysis.
3. We will address minor errors and omissions, such as missing figure captions and discrepancies in transaction rates, to ensure the manuscript's accuracy.

In conclusion, we have outlined our commitment to addressing each comment through substantial revisions aimed at enhancing the manuscript's clarity, depth, and accuracy. We believe these planned modifications will significantly strengthen our contribution to the field of privacy-preserving data aggregation in blockchain-based DR programs. We look forward to the opportunity to revise our manuscript based on this feedback and hope our planned changes will be met with approval.
